# PRODIGY_DS_04

Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion.

## Overview
In this repository we tend to Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion

### DataSet
The dataset used for this project is  'twitter.csv' and reddit.csv. The File Contains 37k comments along with its Sentimental Labelling. All the Comments in the dataset are cleaned and assigned with a Sentimet L Label Using Textblob. These Comments Dataset Can Be used to Build a Sentimental Analysis Machine Learning Model. The other dataset contains 163k tweets along with its Sentimental Labelling. All the Comments in the dataset are cleaned and assigned with a Sentimet Label Using Textblob. These Tweets Dataset Can Be used to Build a Sentimental Analysis Machine Learning Model.
